        <section id="tribute-info">Malcolm X was an American Muslim minister and human rights activist who was a prominent figure during the civil rights movement. A spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the Black community.
            <h2>Key moments in Malcolm X's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1925</strong> Malcolm X is born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, the fourth of Earl and Louise Little's seven children.</li>
                <li><strong>1931</strong> Malcolm father is killed by the Ku Klux Klan.</li>
                <li><strong>1938 </strong> Malcolm's mother is diagnosed as mentally ill and sent to the Kalamazoo State Mental Hospital, where she will stay for 26 years.</li>
                <li><strong>1939</strong> The state places Malcolm's siblings with various foster families, and Malcolm, who has been kicked out of school in the seventh grade, is sent to a juvenile home in the nearly all-white community of Mason, Michigan. He does well at school there, earning straight A's and being elected president of his 8th-grade class, but his teacher discourages him about pursuing his goal of becoming a lawyer.</li>
                <li><strong>1941</strong> Ella Collins (Malcolm's half sister) gains custody of Malcolm and he moves to Boston. Over the next few years, he works a number of odd jobs on railroads, in restaurants and bars, at shoeshine stands, and in a jewelry store. Malcolm learns to dress like a hipster, dyes his hair, and starts hustling in Boston (where he's known as "New York Red"), New York (where the nickname is "Detroit Red"), and Detroit.</li>
                <li><strong>1946</strong> At the age of 20, Malcolm is sent to jail in Charlestown, Massachusetts, and assigned prisoner number 22843. He will remain behind bars until 1952.</li>
                <li><strong>1947</strong> Malcolm meets a fellow convict he calls "Bimbi," who convinces Malcolm to study and learn to develop his mind. In Jarvis' words, in prison "the only way we knew how to rebel was to cram some knowledge into our brains."</li>
                <li><strong>1952</strong> Malcolm is released on parole. He quickly joins the Nation of Islam and attends meetings at Detroit's Temple No. 1, one of the four temples that the Nation operates at the time. Dismayed that the Nation of Islam is not attracting more followers (at the time, total nationwide membership was about 400), Malcolm begins an intensive recruiting campaign with Elijah Muhammad's blessing. Soon membership in the Nation begins to soar.</li>
                <li><strong>1953</strong> Having tripled the membership of the Detroit temple in under a year, Malcolm is appointed assistant minister there.</li>
                <li><strong>1956</strong> Malcolm X attends the first Conference of the Non-aligned Nations in Bandung, Indonesia</li>
                <li><strong>1959</strong> Malcolm makes his first trips abroad, visiting Ghana, Sudan, Nigeria, Iran, Syria, Egypt, and the United Arab Republic; illness prevents him from traveling to Mecca. Meets with President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt.</li>
                <li><strong>1964</strong> Malcolm is suspended by the Nation of Islam, forms the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), reflecting a growing political agenda, and spends nearly five months in Africa visiting heads of state.</li>
                <li><strong>1965</strong> Malcolm X is assassinated at the age of 39 while speaking at an OAAU rally in Harlem; three members of the Nation of Islam are later convicted despite the fact that the assailant apprehended at the scene Talmadge Hayer insisted that his two co-defendants are innocent.</li>
